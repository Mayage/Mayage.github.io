##complete framework for this blog at mid-autumn day in 2016
1. at root we have got index.html as entrance, about.html as greeting, archives.html as guidence for the web.
2. at articles direct, we store the articles and pages as the content for this webblog.

4. Each article has the property: catagory, title, digest, author, comments-lists, created-date.
5. the web is designed as inner-loop.
