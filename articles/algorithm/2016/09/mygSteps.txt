## My experience in ML
I first got in touch with ml was in September 2015 when I was working as a coder for about half year.

After that I gradually read some books and papers in this fields.

## Namingly books or papers or videos 
1) [book] Machine Learning by Zhou Zhihua. I read through it in July and August,2016. This book was written in a straightaway manner which makes it relatively easy and interesting to read. And I would like to introduce this book to any Chinese students or engineerings who wants to have a textbook.
2) [paper] Going deeper with convolutions
3) 机器学习基石，机器学习技法：林轩田 台湾大学
4) http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/. Providing github codes and webpage instruction.
5) 机器学习实践： 并不是很好，感觉；
6) http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/contents.html Webpage likely book
        



## Famouse Figure in this field
1) Andrew Wu
2) FeiFei Li: As Director of Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Lab and Vision Lab, Fei-Fei Li is working to solve AI’s trickiest problems — including image recognition, learning and language processing.
3) Wei Liu: PhD Student of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
4) Geoffrey E. Hinton: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/ 
       - He is leading university of toronto: http://learning.cs.toronto.edu/courses
       - Visual Perception for Autonomous Driving Winter 2016
